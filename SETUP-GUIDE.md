# Kainat SaaS - Setup Guide

## What This Platform Does

Kainat lets users deploy their own AI assistant (powered by OpenClaw) with a few clicks. Users configure their bot through a guided UI, pay (or use the free tier), and get an isolated AI agent running on Railway that responds on their chosen messaging platforms.

## Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/kainat"

# Auth
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="<openssl rand -base64 32>"

# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..."
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."
STRIPE_PRICE_MONTHLY="price_..."
STRIPE_PRICE_THREE_MONTH="price_..."
STRIPE_PRICE_YEARLY="price_..."

# Railway
RAILWAY_API_TOKEN="your-railway-token"
RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"

# Encryption (for API key storage)
ENCRYPTION_KEY="<openssl rand -hex 32>"
```

### 3. Set Up Database

```bash
npm run db:generate   # Generate Prisma client
npm run db:push       # Push schema to PostgreSQL
```

### 4. Set Up Stripe

1. Create account at https://stripe.com
2. Create 3 recurring products:
   - **Monthly**: $29/month
   - **3 Months**: $75 every 3 months
   - **Yearly**: $299/year
3. Copy each product's price ID to `.env`
4. Set up webhook endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
5. Select events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`
6. Copy webhook signing secret to `.env`

For local testing:
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
```

### 5. Set Up Railway

1. Create account at https://railway.app
2. Create a new project (this will host user bot instances)
3. Go to Account Settings > Tokens > Create token
4. Copy token to `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN`
5. Copy project ID from project settings to `RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID`

### 6. Run Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## User Flow

### Onboarding (6 Steps)

1. **Template** - Pick a pre-built template or start from scratch
   - Customer Support Bot, Personal Assistant, Community Manager, Technical Expert
2. **Plan** - Choose subscription tier
   - FREE ($0, 100 msgs/mo, 1 channel), Monthly ($29), 3 Months ($75), Yearly ($299)
3. **AI Provider** - Select provider and enter API key
   - Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Amazon Bedrock, Vercel AI Gateway
   - Model selection + optional failover model
4. **Channels** - Pick messaging platforms
   - 17 channels organized by category (Popular, Enterprise, Privacy, Developer)
   - Per-channel config fields (tokens, keys, etc.)
5. **Personality** - Configure system prompt
   - Guided mode (section-by-section) or freeform
   - 4 prompt templates to start from
6. **Skills** - Enable capabilities
   - Web search, browser, TTS, canvas, cron, memory/RAG

### After Payment

- Stripe webhook fires
- `deployToRailway()` creates an isolated container
- OpenClaw config JSON generated from user selections
- Instance starts and becomes accessible
- User redirected to dashboard

### Free Tier

- No Stripe checkout required
- Direct deployment via `/api/instance/deploy-free`
- 100 messages/month, 1 channel, basic model
- Usage tracked in `Subscription.messagesUsed`

## Dashboard

The main dashboard has 6 tabs:

| Tab | Features |
|-----|----------|
| **Overview** | Instance status, quick actions, onboarding tour, quick access links |
| **Channels** | Channel manager (add/remove/toggle channels post-deploy) |
| **Sessions** | Active sessions viewer, session pruning |
| **Automation** | Cron jobs, webhooks, heartbeat config, WebChat widget |
| **Analytics** | Usage stats, message charts, channel breakdown |
| **Logs** | Real-time log streaming with level filtering |

### Additional Pages

- **Settings** (`/dashboard/settings`) - Inline config editing, API key management
- **Agents** (`/dashboard/agents`) - Multi-agent configuration with routing
- **Skills** (`/dashboard/skills`) - Skills marketplace browser
- **Knowledge** (`/dashboard/knowledge`) - RAG document uploads
- **Analytics** (`/dashboard/analytics`) - Deep analytics with charts
- **Team** (`/dashboard/team`) - Organization & member management

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Railway (not Docker)

User instances deploy to Railway via their GraphQL API, not local Docker. Each user gets an isolated Railway service running the OpenClaw Docker image. This handles scaling, SSL, and uptime automatically.

### API Proxy Pattern

Dashboard management routes (sessions, cron, webhooks) proxy requests to the user's running OpenClaw instance via its `accessUrl`. The SaaS app authenticates the user, then forwards requests to their bot.

### Config Hot-Reload

When users edit config from the Settings page, the PATCH endpoint:
1. Updates the database
2. Rebuilds the OpenClaw config JSON
3. Pushes new environment variables to Railway
4. Triggers a redeploy

No manual redeployment needed.

### Developer API

The `/api/v1/` namespace provides REST access authenticated via Bearer tokens (`knt_` prefixed API keys). Developers can programmatically manage instances, check status, and control their bots.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Landing page loads correctly
- [ ] Registration and login work
- [ ] Onboarding flow completes (all 6 steps)
- [ ] Template selection pre-fills config
- [ ] Free tier deploys without Stripe
- [ ] Stripe checkout works (test mode, card: 4242 4242 4242 4242)
- [ ] Webhook triggers deployment
- [ ] Dashboard shows instance status
- [ ] Start/stop/restart controls work

## Troubleshooting

**"Prisma client errors"**
```bash
npm run db:generate
```

**"Stripe webhook not working locally"**
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
```

**"Database connection failed"**
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running
- Check credentials and database exists

**"Railway deployment fails"**
- Verify `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` is valid
- Check project ID matches
- Ensure Railway account has available resources
